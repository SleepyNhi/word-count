package wordcount;
/*Nhi Tuong CSC 3410 MW Assignment #2
 * 
 * Purpose: To gain experiences with string objects and algorithms manipulations.
 * 			To read the user's text file and scan the amount of words and print it. To also
 * 			calculate different count attribute and add the attribute to the user's file without
 * 			overriding the previous data. 
 * Solution:The first solution was to use a scanner to ask for the user's input and 
 * 			code cases that identifies possible errors or empty text files that allows the user
 * 			to adjust files as needed.
 * 			Then reading the text file and saving it to a string variable that would be
 * 			used in multiple method parameters. The methods would implement specific algorithms
 * 			to manipulate the data in the string variable to get a desire output. Then the method is 
 * 			called and printed to show different file numeric attributes. This method
 * 			allows the user to preserve the original text file while the copy gets manipulated.
 * 			Then a texteditor is used (printwriter) to add the printed attributes/results to 
 * 			the user's text file that does not override any previous data.
 * Data Structure: String Objects
 * How to use the Program: The program will ask for a file name once the user runs it.
 * 			Please input the output name. 
 * 			There is no need to add the extension file tag. It is implemented in the code. The 
 * 			output.txt file must be in the wordcount folder, where the src and bin are located 
 * 			in order for the .txt file to be reached. Everything else is self executed.
 * 			The user's file will be changed at the end of the program. So the user should
 * 			reopen the text file to see the results added. 
 * Purpose of Each Class - There is only one class. The wordcount class executes different
 * 			algorithms that uses method such as: word count, sentence count, alphanumeric character count,
 * 			punctuation count, vowel count, and line count. Each method calculate certain word/character
 * 			/punctuation count and are called to the text file object and print out the word count results.
 * 			Use scanner and file to read input and strings that allows methods to effectively execute 
 * 			implemented algorithms.
